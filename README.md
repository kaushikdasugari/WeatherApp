Hello this is a basic Weather web application, which uses OpenWeatherAPI for the information.
I have created two seperate projects one for the frontend using react and .net web api as the backend.
I have included these projects together and then ran the application.

I have created only a skeletal application with just basic info.
Please make a note that my backend has different file structure , but not as shown here.

Please feel free to use modify accordingly.
